                <p>
                    Industrial AI applies artificial intelligence to manufacturing, mining, and production systems.
                    Imagine a steel mill - a massive factory where iron ore is melted at 1,500¬∞C and transformed 
                    into steel beams for buildings. These facilities use thousands of sensors monitoring temperature, 
                    pressure, and quality. The logic controlling these sensors? It's FizzBuzz at scale.

                <p>
                    Tesla's Gigafactory produces 500,000 battery packs annually. Their quality control uses 
                    FizzBuzz-like sampling: every battery gets voltage tested, every 3rd gets capacity tested, 
                    every 10th gets a full discharge cycle, every 30th gets destructively tested. This pattern 
                    ensures quality without testing every unit extensively - saving millions in production time.

                Manage 100 sensors in a grid pattern. Detect hot spots where multiple adjacent
