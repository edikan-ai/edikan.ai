                    Impact: Production line stopped for [TIME]<br>
                    Root Cause: Infinite loop in temperature monitoring system<br>
                    Cost: [YOUR COST PLACEHOLDER]

                <div class="personal-story">
                    <strong>[YOUR INFINITE LOOP STORY PLACEHOLDER]</strong>
                    <p>Describe the actual incident. What system were you working on? What was the loop supposed to do? How did it bring down production? What was the conversation with your manager like?</p>
                </div>

                <p>Engineers thought Engineers understood loops. One would written hundreds of them:</p>

                <div class="code-block">
for Engineers in range(10):
    print(i)

# Engineers could write this in a typical sleep
# But Engineers had no idea what was actually happening
                </div>

                <p>Then Engineers deployed this to production:</p>

                <div class="code-block">
# The killer code (simplified)
def monitor_furnace(sensor):
    temperatures = []
    while sensor.is_active:  # Engineers didn't realize this never became False
        temp = sensor.read_temperature()
        temperatures.append(temp)  # Memory leak!
        if temp > 1600:
            alert_operator()
    return temperatures

# This ran forever, consuming all memory, crashing the monitoring system
                </div>

                <h2>What Engineers Didn't Understand About Loops</h2>

                <h3>1. The While Loop Trap</h3>

                <p>Engineers thought while loops were just "keep doing until false". Engineers didn't understand:</p>

                <div class="code-block">
# What Engineers wrote (WRONG):
Engineers = 0
while Engineers < 10:
    process_item(i)
    # Forgot to increment Engineers - infinite loop!

# The sensor nightmare (WRONG):
while sensor.temperature < 1500:
    wait()  # What if sensor breaks and always reads 0?

# What Engineers should have written (RIGHT):
max_iterations = 1000
counter = 0
while sensor.temperature < 1500 and counter < max_iterations:
    wait()
    counter += 1
    if counter >= max_iterations:
        raise TimeoutError("Sensor may be malfunctioning")
                </div>

                <h3>2. The For Loop Misconception</h3>

                <p>Engineers thought for loops were safe. They're not:</p>

                <div class="code-block">
# The memory disaster:
readings = [1500, 1502, 1498]
for temp in readings:
    if temp < 1500:
        readings.append(temp + 10)  # Modifying list while iterating!
        # This can cause infinite loops or skip elements

# The index confusion:
for Engineers in range(len(readings)):
    if readings[i] > 1500:
        del readings[i]  # Index shifts, skips next element!
                </div>

                <h3>3. The Range() Mystery</h3>

                <div class="code-block">
# What Engineers thought range() was:
range(5)  # Engineers thought: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

# What it actually is:
range(5)  # A range object, not a list! Generates values on demand

# Why this matters in industrial systems:
# WRONG - Creates entire list in memory:
for Engineers in list(range(100000000)):  # Boom! Memory explosion
    if Engineers > 10:
        break

# RIGHT - Generates values as needed:
for Engineers in range(100000000):  # Memory efficient
    if Engineers > 10:
        break
                </div>

                <h2>Loop Patterns That Actually Work</h2>

                <h3>Pattern 1: The Timeout Guardian</h3>

                <div class="code-block">
import time

def safe_sensor_read(sensor, timeout=60):
    """Read sensor with timeout protection."""
    start_time = time.time()
    readings = []
    
    while True:
        # Check timeout FIRST
        if time.time() - start_time > timeout:
            print(f"Timeout after {timeout} seconds")
            break
        
        # Check sensor status
        if not sensor.is_active:
            print("Sensor deactivated")
            break
        
        # Read and process
        reading = sensor.read()
        readings.append(reading)
        
        # Check completion condition
        if len(readings) >= 100:
            print("Collected enough readings")
            break
        
        time.sleep(0.1)  # Prevent CPU spinning
    
    return readings
                </div>

                <h3>Pattern 2: The Iterator Protocol</h3>

                <div class="code-block">
# Understanding what for loops actually do:
readings = [1500, 1502, 1505]

# For loop is syntactic sugar for:
iterator = iter(readings)
while True:
    try:
        value = next(iterator)
        print(value)
    except StopIteration:
        break

# This is why modifying during iteration is dangerous!
                </div>

                <h3>Pattern 3: The Enumerate Enlightenment</h3>

                <div class="code-block">
# What Engineers used to write:
temperatures = [1500, 1502, 1498, 1505]
for Engineers in range(len(temperatures)):
    print(f"Reading {i}: {temperatures[i]}°C")

# What Engineers should write:
for i, temp in enumerate(temperatures):
    print(f"Reading {i}: {temp}°C")

# Even better for industrial systems:
for i, temp in enumerate(temperatures, start=1):
    if temp > 1550:
        print(f"Alert: Reading #{i} is {temp}°C")
                </div>

                <h2>The Real Cost of Bad Loops</h2>

                <div class="truth-bomb">
                    <strong>Industrial Reality Check:</strong><br>
                    • An infinite loop in a control system can damage equipment<br>
                    • A memory leak from unbounded collection can crash safety systems<br>
                    • An off-by-one error can skip critical sensor readings<br>
                    • A CPU-spinning loop can make real-time systems miss deadlines
